# Contribute to pandas

_pandas_ is and always will be **free**. To make the development sustainable, we need _pandas_ users, corporate
or individual, to support the development by providing their time and money.

You can find more information about current developers in the [team page](about/team.html),
and about current sponsors in the [sponsors page](about/sponsors.html).
Financial contributions will mainly be used to advance in the [pandas roadmap](about/roadmap.html).

- If your **company or organization** is interested in helping make pandas better, please contact us at [info@numfocus.org](mailto:info@numfocus.org)
